# examples/

Self-contained, side-by-side examples for the RMACC talk on migrating a
Snakemake workflow from version 7 to version 9. Each subdirectory implements
the **same 4-rule workflow shape** (`split_input` → `align` → `call_variants`
→ `summarize`) so the differences between them are *patterns*, not workload.

These examples exist because the production workflow the talk is built around
contains private research data and cannot be distributed. The Snakefiles,
profiles, container recipe, and env files here mirror every Snakemake-level
pattern referenced in the slides without leaking that workflow.

```

## What each example demonstrates

The two subdirectories are deliberately paired so a `diff` between matching
files tells the migration story:

```bash
diff -u snakemake7/Snakefile snakemake9/Snakefile
diff -u snakemake7/run.sh    snakemake9/run.sh
```

### `snakemake7/` — the legacy patterns

| Pattern | Where |
|---|---|
| `singularity:` repeated per rule | `Snakefile` (`align`, `call_variants`) |
| String-typed `runtime` (`'15m'`, `'4h'`) | every rule's `resources:` block |
| Fixed-integer `mem_mb`, no retry backoff | every rule's `resources:` block |
| Bare `python` in shell rules | `Snakefile` (`split_input`, `summarize`) |
| Resources live in the Snakefile, not a profile | every rule |
| Legacy `--cluster 'sbatch ...'` submission | `run.sh` |

### `snakemake9/` — the current patterns

| Pattern | Where |
|---|---|
| Global `container:` directive | `Snakefile` top |
| `get_python_executable()` resolved from `$CONDA_PREFIX` | `Snakefile` top |
| Resources moved out of the Snakefile | `profiles/slurm/config.yaml` `set-resources:` |
| `lambda wildcards, attempt: ...` backoff on heavy rules | `set-resources:` for `align`, `call_variants` |
| Integer-minute runtimes (not `'4h'`) | `set-resources:` |
| Rate limiting (`max-jobs-per-timespan`, `max-status-checks-per-second`) | `profiles/slurm/config.yaml` |
| Automatic partition selection from a partition table | `profiles/slurm/public.yaml` + `--slurm-partition-config` |
| `--executor slurm` + `--workflow-profile` invocation | `run.sh`, `sbatch.sh` |
| Driver-as-SLURM-job pattern | `sbatch.sh` |
| Apptainer container recipe | `container/tools.def` |

## How to use these examples

These are **illustrative, not runnable end-to-end** — the input FASTA and
reference paths in each `config.yaml` are placeholders, and `snakemake7/`
intentionally has no working container build. To exercise them:

1. Read the per-directory `README.md` for the patterns being demonstrated.
2. `diff` matching files between `snakemake7/` and `snakemake9/` to see the
   migration mechanically.
3. For the Snakemake 9 example, build the container with
   `apptainer build snakemake9/container/tools.sif snakemake9/container/tools.def`
   and create the env with `mamba env create -f snakemake9/env.yml` — that
   gets you a workflow you could point at real data with minor edits.
